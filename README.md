We provide a python script to constructÂ montmorillonite structures (i.e., Arizona-type and Wyoming-type) from the pyrophyllite model. To run this script, you should install the packmol software first.

The montmorillonite structure is in lmp.data format in order to run molecular simulation in lammps.

Example structures of Arizona-type and Wyoming-type montmorillonite are also shown.
